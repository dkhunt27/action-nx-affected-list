# action-nx-affected-list

Github action for outputting a list of affected nx projects (apps and libs)

## Action inputs

The possible inputs for this action are:

``` yaml
inputs:
    base:
        description: Base of the current branch (usually main)
        required: false
    head:
        description: Latest commit of the current branch (usually HEAD)
        required: false
```

## Action outputs

The outputs for this action are:

``` yaml
outputs:
    affected:
        description: array of affected projects (apps/libs) names
    hasAffected:
        description: true/false if there are affected projects (apps/libs)
```

## Usage

``` yaml
      - name: Check for Affected Projects
        uses: dkhunt27/action-nx-affected-list@v5
        id: checkForAffected

      - if: steps.checkForAffected.outputs.hasAffected == 'true'
        name: Build (Nx Affected)
        uses: mansagroup/nrwl-nx-action@v2
        with:
          targets: build
          affected: true
          nxCloud: false

      - if: contains(steps.checkForAffected.outputs.affected, 'someAppName')
        ### do something specific for someAppName
```

## Making changes and pushing releases

- make new branch and make changes
- `npm run all`
- `git commit/push changes`
- make PR back to main
- wait for pipelines to finish (test will always finish with an error since this isn't a nx monorepo)
- `git checkout main`
- `git pull`
- `git tag v1`
- `SKIP_HOOKS=true git push origin v1`
- in github, edit tag and save (this will push to marketplace)

## NPM Check

```bash
npm run npm:check
```
